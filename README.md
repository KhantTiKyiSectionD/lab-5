This project is a simple website dedicated to the South Korean indie band, Wave to Earth.
It has sections about the band, some of their popular songs, and a media section where use rs can listen to music and watch a video.
Font Colors: I used white for the text because it stands out with dark theme background and make it easier to read. I also used a pinkish color for the headings beacause its kind of wave to earth signature color.
Layout: I used a two-column layout for the "About" section and the media section (with the audio player and video), so both are side by side which help to keeps the website clean.
Flexbox: I chose Flexbox for positioning elements because itâ€™s simple and responsive, making sure everything looks good on different devices.
First, I made the basic structure of the website using HTML inculding about the information of the band
Then, I styled the website with CSS, adding colors and layout which include every main important part of the website
I added the audio and video elements for the song "Seasons." near each other
Finally, I tested the site on multiple broswer including google and firefox to make sure that there is no error
I also add my email so that the user can contact me when they have a queston to ask
